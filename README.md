ATTENDACE APPLICATION
This is an android application to take attendance in the class. This app consists of an opening interface of four years (Designed for four years course). You can select the year to which you want to take the attendance. Inside every year we have features to take the attendance, to see studentâ€™s data, to check the date wise data, to examine the best attended students. You can also have the list of students who have an attendance of more than 75% and as well as those students with less than 75% of attendance. While taking the attendance of students you can select the date for which you want to take the attendance. On clicking the roll number of the person if the background colour of the roll number is green then it changes to red and vice versa. Green background indicates that the student is present and red background indicates that the student is absent. On the same interface the app is provided with submit option. On clicking the submit option the data is add to the attendance. You can also view complete attendance data of that year.
